    versus the amount actually consumed.

    The max number of running jobs each association can have at any given time.

.. option:: --max-active-jobs

    any given time.

.. option:: --max-nodes

    The max number of nodes each association can have across all of their running
    jobs.

.. option:: --max-cores

    The max number of cores each association can have across all of their running
    jobs.

.. option:: --queues

    A comma-separated list of all of the queues each association can run jobs

    A comma-separated list of all of the projects each association can run jobs
    under.

.. option:: --default-project

by passing ``-1`` as the value for the field. Multiple fields can be edited at
the same time by passing them on the command line.
